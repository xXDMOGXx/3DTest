# 3DTest
A python based 3D environment that I'm coding from basically scratch

Features (So Far)
- Display an object in 3d (obviously)
- Not orthographic. It actually has perspective
- Multiple objects able to be drawn independently
- Animated rotation
- Able to control the location, rotation, scale, color, and mesh of an object
- Lighting! And it works properly no matter the color (which is defined in rgb)
- Can load objects from a .obj file. You can load in whatever you want (as long as it's triangulated and the poly count is somewhat low)

(Math is hard lol)
